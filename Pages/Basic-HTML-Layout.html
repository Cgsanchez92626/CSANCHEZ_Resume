    <h2>Significant Accomplishments</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Involved in Design, Implement and Maintain a Large Data Architecture Project at Orbitz Worldwide where I 
                maintained more than 65 Database schemas in support of the OLTP applications. Each database schema 
                containing from 30 to 500 tables. Ensuring that data is replicated to the Data Warehouse in a timely manner.</li> 
            <li>Design and Implementation of a Database Change Management system geared at automating the tracking and 
                deployment of database changes while ensuring backwards compatibility, auditability, reversibility of over 65 
                Database Schemas totaling about 6TB of transactional data. Cutting the database cycle time from 14 days to 2 
                days on average.</li>
            <li>Design and implementation of process to train development staff of 500 on an on demand basis to allow them to 
                code and deploy their own DB Changes with Data Architecture overview. This allowed the organization to deliver 
                database changes expediently in conjunction with the organization’s Agile direction.</li> 
            <li>Design repeatable process for migrating each Oracle database schema from 9i and 10g to Exadata RAC with 
                minimal down time and rollback strategy. By using master/master Goldengate replication allowing pre-population 
                of the new database and outage only during the time to switch the application. Moving to Exadata RAC improved 
                application performance in most schemas by 60%, reduced licensing fees by $500,000/year, and allowed for 
                efficiency of optimized operational processes.</li>
            <li>Designed and implemented database model to track replication strategy of any and all objects, either at a schema 
                or table level. Developed utilities to read replication rules and replicate data to the Operational Data Store, produces 
                reports to report on delivery status and details of replication allowing for further distribution of data to the Data 
                Warehouse </li>
            <li>Designed Dimensional data model to allow for business reporting, Implemented Informatica sessions for populating 
                data from the Operational Data Store to the Data Warehouse. Used Business Objects to design reports for the 
                business units.</li>
